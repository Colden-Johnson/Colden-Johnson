-Hello, I'm @Colden-Johnson

-I began learning R and Python to conduct data work for a research project on environmental policy.

-I've taken 1 year each of JavaScript and R, and I'm currently focusing on completing some baseline projects in Python.

-I haven't uploaded much of my previous work to GitHub, but I'm hoping to keep better documentation from now on!
