-Hello, I'm @Colden-Johnson

-I began learning RStudio and Python to conduct data cleaning/analysis for a passion project on international environmental policy

-I've taken 1 year each of JavaScript and RStudio, and I'm currently focusing on completing some baseline projects in Python

-I haven't uploaded a lot of my previous work to GitHub, but I'm hoping to show better documentation and look for collaboration!
